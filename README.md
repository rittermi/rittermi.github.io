# Feeling Fuzzy

Summary:
This work focuses (or doesn't focus) on the current insecurity about the future that many people are facing. It takes a piece of text and uses p5.js to fuzz out the text so that it cannot be read unless the user hovers the mouse over a set point--in this case, the center of the page.
However, we have the ability to directly change and impact our future through our choices, represented in the text area and submission button where they can enter text to change the message. Some of our choices are deliberate but lead to outcomes we might not expect, as seen in the random nature of the background color changes; and some things surprise us as shown if you accidentally click the canvas which triggers music. If you click it again, it stops.

Instructions for running the project:

This project is hosted directly at https://rittermi.github.io/ or can be downloaded and uploaded to p5.js for modification. Be sure to create an assets section and include the bgmus.mp3 file for the sound to run properly.

Statement: 
Much of this semester has been focused on the importance of text and words. This projects plays upon the uncertainies of the future in combination with the power of our words to create something unclear.
The initial text will be harder for the user to decipher than the text they input themselves. With practice and a little patience, eventually users will be able to write out and see the futures they choose for themselves while interacting with this work.
